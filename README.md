# Azure IoT Curriculum

**This repo is still under development - check back often for updates**

This repo contains hands-on-labs and other lab and workshop based material designed to support the creation of IoT curricula for higher education, covering IoT and AI on the edge. All the labs use physical devices, such as Raspberry Pis and NVIDIA Jetson boards, and are designed for in-class or at home study. As an educator, you would use these labs in a blended learning environment, teaching concepts and theory in the classroom, mixed with labs from here to supplement the course and provide hands-on experience.

## Hardware needs

These labs make use of a variety of hardware, all connected to cloud services. Each lab indicates up front what hardware is required. There is also an overall list for an 'IoT Cart' that provides a complete, all-in-one hardware solution that covers all these labs. This is designed to be a 'course in a box' - you purchase everything on the list and that can be shared between groups of students learning IoT in a more IoT focused degree program, rather than a single course as part of a wider technology-based learning program. Details of the cart are in the [Cart](./Cart) folder.

All the content contained in this repo is free for you to use in your courses however you see fit. We will endeavour to keep the content up to date, but seeing as technology moves fast, things may be missed. If you find any errors in these materials, please either [raise an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-curriculum/issues), or feel free to [raise a PR with the fix](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-curriculum/pulls).

## Azure accounts

These labs are designed for courses where Azure resources are provided to students by the institution. To try them out, you can use one of our free accounts:

* If you are a student aged 18 and up and have an email address from an academic institution, you can sign up for the free Azure for Students offer at [azure.microsoft.com/free/students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=iotcurriculum-github-jabenn) without a credit card. At the time of writing this gives you $100 of credit to use over 12 months, as well as free tiers of a number of services for that 12 months. At the end of the 12 months, if you are still a student you can renew and get another $100 in credit and 12 months of free services.

* If you are not a student, you can sign up at [azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=iotcurriculum-github-jabenn). You'll need a credit card for verification purposes only, you'll not be billed unless you decide to upgrade your account to a paid offering. At the time of writing the free account will give you US$200 of free credit to spend on what you like in the first 30 days, 12 months of free services, plus a load of services that have tiers that are always free.
